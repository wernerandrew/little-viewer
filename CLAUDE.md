# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an empty repository named "image-reviewer" that appears to be initialized but contains no project files yet. The repository is not a git repository and has no package.json, README.md, or other configuration files.

## Getting Started

Since this is an empty repository, you'll need to:

1. Initialize the project structure based on the user's requirements
2. Set up appropriate build tools, package managers, and configuration files as needed
3. Follow the user's specifications for the image review functionality they want to implement

## Notes

- No existing code architecture to follow
- No existing build or test commands
- No existing development patterns or conventions
- Project structure and technology choices should be determined based on user requirements
